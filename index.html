            <p>Hi there, my name is Jinsung Kim, a **curious** software developer.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>It is motivating that learning how to program opens doors to connect myself with the world. Although I have yet to create a service that reaches millions, every day I am taking one step closer to achieving my goal.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>My passion extends beyond simply coding; I deeply enjoy the full process of conceptualizing, designing, building, and improving applications.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>As a software engineer, I view myself as a problem solver first and foremost. I firmly believe that the best developers don't just code—they create thoughtful, innovative solutions that can make a significant impact on the world. That's precisely what I strive to do every day.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Feel free to explore my work, learn about my skills, and get in touch. I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
